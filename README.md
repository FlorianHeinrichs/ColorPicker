Note: This application is used as an example in introductory courses about artificial intelligence (AI) 
to spark discussions what AI is (and what not). In this context, the application serves as an example 
of logic-based software.

Possible inputs are:
- colors, e.g. "red", "yellow", "orange", etc.
- adding/subtracting colors with the *more*/*less* keywords, e.g. "more red", "less yellow", etc.
- making the color lighter/darker with the *lighter*/*darker* keywords

The web app is based on Python3 and the dependencies flask, flask_wtf, wtforms, matplotlib and numpy.
